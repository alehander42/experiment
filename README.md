# experiment

a playground for experiments with genetic algorithms, neural networks, pattern recognition, heuristic algorithms etc


## technologies

Python, libraries, tensorflow

## why python?

Python has a huge ecosystem and community for scientific computing,
bioinformatics, visualization etc. It's big in education, academia and research and it's
really good for prototyping and experimenting with new concepts and ideas.

It has many optimized implementations too (Nuitka, Pypy, Jython etc).

Other possible choices:

* C / C++ / Java / C# 
  
  Not so pleasant for prototyping, no REPL (actually a big deal)

  Good for optimized implementations (or if JVM / .NET have a really good library for something)

* Javascript / Ruby / Perl / Go / other-popular-language
  
  Not comparable to Python for scientific computing

* Haskell / Scala / Rust etc
  
  I don't really know them so well.


## genetic algorithms

play with [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)

## neural networks

* [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)
* [keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)
* [pybrain](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain)
* [theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
* [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

## image recognition

* [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
* [opencv](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

## natural languages

* [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/)

## classification

* [BayesPy](http://www.bayespy.org/)








usual workflow: 
play with a concept, try to apply it
vesela
for a simplified real-world problem, compare it with existing
solutions and other possible ai methods
